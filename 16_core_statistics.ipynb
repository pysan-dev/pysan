    "Summary statistics are a great way to gain insights into single sequences, but can also be used for comparisons between sequences. Methods for computing summary statistics on a single sequence exist in the `pysan.core.statistics` module, and include recurrence, entropy, turbulence, complexity, and routine statistics. This module doesn't contain any plotting methods as each of the summary statistics is a single number. Visit the `pysan.multi.attributes` module for plotting capabilities for summary statistics across collections of sequences."
